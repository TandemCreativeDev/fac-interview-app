user: Hi
assistant: Hello! I appreciate your time today to discuss your experiences and thoughts on AI in learning. To start, could you tell me a bit about yourself? Feel free to share your age, gender (if comfortable), what you're studying, and what you hope to do next.
user: this is a test at 9:57
assistant: I understand this is a test. However, for the purposes of this interview, I'm meant to conduct a genuine conversation about AI and learning from a student's perspective. Since you haven't provided any information about yourself or your experiences with AI, I don't have enough context to continue the interview as designed. Is there anything you'd like to share about your background or experiences with AI in education? If not, we may need to conclude this test session.
